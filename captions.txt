2. FILE: figure_004.png
   CAPTION: The image depicts two leaves, labeled as (a) and (b), each showing different patterns of coloration. Leaf (a) has a more uniform distribution of green and yellow patches, suggesting a healthy state or possibly a natural variation in pigmentation. Leaf (b), on the other hand, displays a more irregular and concentrated pattern of blue and yellow patches, which could indicate a disease, pest infestation, or environmental stress affecting the leaf's health. Such visual representations are often used in studies related to plant pathology, ecology, or environmental science to analyze the impact of various factors on plant health.

3. FILE: figure_006.png
   CAPTION: The image depicts a scientific experiment setup involving a potted rose plant enclosed in a bell jar. In part (a), the bell jar is shown with a watch-glass containing potassium hydroxide placed over it. This setup is likely used to observe the effects of the gas produced by the plant on the potassium hydroxide. In part (b), the bell jar is shown without the watch-glass, suggesting that the experiment is in progress or has been completed, and the effects of the plant's gas on the potassium hydroxide can be observed directly. This type of experiment is often used to demonstrate principles of chemistry, such as the reaction between plant respiration and potassium hydroxide.

4. FILE: figure_008.png
   CAPTION: The image is a detailed anatomical diagram of the human digestive system. It shows various parts of the digestive tract, including the mouth (buccal cavity), oesophagus, stomach, small intestine, large intestine (colon), liver, pancreas, gall bladder, bile duct, and appendix. Each part is labeled, providing a clear understanding of their locations and functions within the digestive system. This type of diagram is commonly used in educational materials to help students and individuals learn about human anatomy and physiology.

5. FILE: figure_010.png
   CAPTION: The image depicts two test tubes labeled (a) and (b), each containing a different setup. In test tube (a), there is a rubber tube connected to a pichkari, which is a traditional Indian water toy. The pichkari is inserted into the rubber tube, which is then connected to the test tube filled with lime water. Test tube (b) shows a similar setup but with a tube containing lime water instead of the rubber tube. The purpose of these setups is likely to demonstrate a chemical reaction, possibly involving carbon dioxide or another gas that reacts with lime water to produce a visible change, such as the formation of a white precipitate.

6. FILE: figure_012.png
   CAPTION: This image provides a detailed diagram of the human respiratory system. It illustrates the pathway of air from the nasal passage and mouth cavity through the pharynx, larynx, trachea, and into the bronchi, which branch out into the bronchioles. These bronchioles lead to the alveoli, where gas exchange occurs. The diagram also highlights the lungs, diaphragm, ribs, and the rings of cartilage that support the trachea. This visual aid is useful for understanding the anatomy and function of the respiratory system.

7. FILE: figure_014.png
   CAPTION: The image depicts a detailed diagram of the human circulatory system, specifically focusing on the heart and its connections to the lungs and body. Here's a breakdown of the components shown:

1. **Pulmonary Artery**: This artery carries deoxygenated blood from the right ventricle of the heart to the lungs.
2. **Lung Capillaries**: These are the tiny blood vessels in the lungs where gas exchange occurs. Oxygen from the inhaled air diffuses into the blood, and carbon dioxide from the blood diffuses into the air.
3. **Pulmonary Vein**: This vein carries oxygenated blood from the lungs back to the left atrium of the heart.
4. **Vena Cava**: This large vein carries deoxygenated blood from the body back to the right atrium of the heart.
5. **Aorta**: The aorta is the main artery that carries oxygenated blood from the left ventricle of the heart to the rest of the body.
6. **Capillaries in Body Organs Apart from the Lungs**: These capillaries facilitate the exchange of nutrients, gases, and waste products between the blood and body tissues.

The diagram illustrates the bidirectional flow of blood through the heart and the lungs, highlighting the essential role of the heart in pumping blood and the lungs in facilitating gas exchange. This understanding is crucial for comprehending how the circulatory system functions to maintain homeostasis in the body.

8. FILE: figure_016.png
   CAPTION: The image depicts a tree illustrating the process of transpiration. Transpiration is the process by which plants release water vapor into the atmosphere through their leaves. In the image, arrows are shown emanating from the tree's leaves, indicating the direction in which water vapor is being released. This visual representation helps to convey the concept of how trees contribute to the water cycle by releasing moisture into the air.

9. FILE: figure_018.png
   CAPTION: The image illustrates the structure of a nephron, which is the functional unit of the kidney responsible for filtering blood and producing urine. Key components labeled in the diagram include the glomerulus, Bowman's capsule, tubular part of the nephron, branch of the renal artery, branch of the renal vein, capillaries, and the collecting duct. The glomerulus is a network of capillaries where blood is filtered, and the Bowman's capsule surrounds the glomerulus. The tubular part of the nephron includes the proximal convoluted tubule, loop of Henle, and distal convoluted tubule, each involved in different stages of filtration and reabsorption. The branch of the renal artery supplies blood to the nephron, and the branch of the renal vein carries filtered blood away. The collecting duct system helps regulate the concentration of substances in the urine. This detailed diagram aids in understanding the complex processes that occur within a nephron.

10. FILE: figure_020.png
   CAPTION: The image illustrates the process of hemodialysis, a medical procedure used to filter blood when the kidneys are unable to perform this function effectively. Here's a breakdown of the components and their roles:

1. **Patient**: The individual receiving the dialysis treatment is lying down, indicating they are undergoing the procedure.

2. **Line from artery to pump**: This line is inserted into an artery and connected to a pump. The pump helps circulate the blood through the dialysis machine.

3. **Tubing made of a selectively permeable membrane**: This tubing is crucial as it allows waste products to pass through while preventing larger molecules like proteins and cells from passing through. This selective permeability ensures that only waste products are removed from the blood.

4. **Line from apparatus to vein**: This line connects the dialysis machine to a vein, facilitating the flow of blood into and out of the machine.

5. **Dialysing solution**: There are two types of dialysing solutions depicted:
   - **Fresh dialysing solution**: This solution is used to clean the blood as it passes through the dialysis machine.
   - **Used dialysing solution**: This solution contains urea and excess salts, which are removed from the blood during the dialysis process.

6. **Arrows indicating blood flow**: The arrows show the direction of blood flow through the dialysis machine, from the patient's vein to the dialysing solution, and then back to the patient's artery.

This diagram provides a clear visual representation of how hemodialysis works, highlighting the key components and their functions in the process.
